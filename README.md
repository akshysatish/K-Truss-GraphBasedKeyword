# K-Truss-GraphBasedKeyword
**Graph-based keyword extraction** \
Natural Language Processing model blended with graph method K-Truss/k-core truss decomposition to create a Graph Based Keyword Extractor. The keywords or keyphrases extracted are done so based on relevance or how important the word is in context of the sentence. Words of a sentence are ranked to get the most important words or keywords. \
Considering that more than 80 percent of the data we generate every day is unstructured ― meaning it’s not organized in a predefined way and, therefore, is hard to analyze and process ― keyword extraction allows to lift the most important words from huge sets of data in just seconds and obtain insights about the topics.
